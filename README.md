## Videogames Database VueJS Web Application

Using RAWG.IO API for data and all custom css/sass for overall look and feel.

Run npm install and provide your own API key from RAWG.io inside .env (you must make one in your own environment)

My first VueJS application from learning ReactJS. Overall much quicker to build with learning new css attribute along the way.
